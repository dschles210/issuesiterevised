 <h3>TAMH provides information on mental health, so that the public can have reliable data and access to resources needed to get help.</h3>
 <h3>Talking About Mental Health, or TAMH, is an organizaiton aimed to ensure that everyone looking for information on mental health in the pandemic is accurate and up to date. This shows that while researching this, you are not alone. We provide information on the history of mental health and what a negative stigma can do to those with mental illnesses. We also provide resources in order to help those who do not know where to start.</h3>     
<p>In 2020, a pandemic hit the world. Not only did a pandemic hit, but also a mental health epidemic in result from the pandemic. Mental health has never had more recognition than it did during the pandemic. So what? Now that there are no lockdowns, people are back at wrok, kids back at school, etc. the conversation around mental health has fell off. Mental health needs to be a national conversation in order to ensure adults and the growing generation there are enough funds and resources to help those that need it.</p>
<br>
<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and to mitigation activities, including the impact of physical distancing and stay-at-home orders. Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably in the United States during April–June of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm" target="_blank">In a website by the CDC, they state </a>during June 24–30, 2020, a total of 5,412 adults completed web-based surveys. Participants included 3,683 (68.1%) first-time respondents and 1,729 (31.9%) respondents who had completed a related survey about their mental health during April 2–8 20 20 and May 5–12 2020. 1,497 (27.7%) respondents participated during all three surveys. The U.S. population by gender, age, and race/ethnicity of participants were all taken into account. Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder were assessed using the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and symptoms of a COVID-19–related TSRD were assessed using the six-item Impact of Event Scale. Respondents also reported whether they had started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19 or seriously considered suicide in the 30 days preceding the survey.</p>
 <h3>Survey and the Numbers</h3>
<p>To assess mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the pandemic, <a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm" target="_blank">representative panel surveys were conducted by the CDC </a> of participants older than 18 years old. 40.9% of participants reported at least one adverse mental health/behavioral condition. 30.9% of participants reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder. 26.3% reported symptoms of trauma/stress-related disorder (TSDR) related to the pandemic. The percentage of participants who reported having seriously considered suicide within the 30 days before completing the survey was 10.7%, but of that percentage the suicidal ideations were highest in self-reported unpaid caregiver for adults, essential workers, and those aged between 18-24 years old. Prevalence of symptoms of adverse mental or behavioral health conditions varied significantly among subgroups. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among males than among females. Symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder, COVID-19–related TSRD, and serious suicidal ideation in the previous 30 days were most commonly reported by persons aged 18–24 years; prevalence decreased progressively with age.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> As we can see, mental health during the pandemic was heavily reported on, as it was its own epidemic. But what about before and after the pandemic? There are little to no studies that can be found on the decreasing mental health status of the youth across America before COVID, with only a few more after lockdowns to show the difference isolation can make on a person. Mental health was studied more than ever during the pandemic, and I'm glad! It should be studied! The age group with the highest percentages across the board were 18-24 year olds. Why is that? Because mental illness in this age group did not solely start IN the pandemic, but before it. Caseworkers, therapists, behavioral specialists, etc. were severely underpaid and understaffed before 2020, but the outcry for more professionals in 2020 was outstanding. People only seemed to care about the shortages when it solely affected them, but what about those of us who struggled before and after and got longer wait times, even as long-term clients? Mental health statistics should be run more often than once in a lockdown and once after. There is still an epidemic, but it is seen less, because less people are now experiencing it.
