<h3>*Trigger Warning: mention of alcohol, drug abuse, eating disorders and suicide. The following story explains childhood trauma and how to heal/cope with the mental health disorder I was diadnosed with.*</h3>
    
<p>My name is Desitny. I am 20 years old, come from a small town in Illinois, and am now attending a university thirty minutes away from my hometown. My mental health journey started without me completely understanding that I was struggling with my mental health. My parents divorced when my brother (18) and I were young. My mother started dating another man my brother and I vaguely knew afterward, and soon moved in with him, while my dad moved outside of town to a farm, and it was just us three for a long time. The other man that my mother got into a relationship with had two kids (male 27 and female 25) from his previous marriage that my brother and I played with from time to time, which is how we knew him. Things went downhill pretty quickly after we moved in; drama with his ex-wife, fights between my mother and him, fights with him and his kids, etc. This was hard on my brother and I as we had not encountered these fights between our own mother and father, much less more kids and adults involved. I later found out that my mom was planning on leaving and when she went to a hospital after a physical fight they had, she found out she was pregnant. So, she stayed. </p>
<br>
<p>This begins a journey of alcohol, drugs, and fights. A toxic environment for children from the ages of fifteen to six. My youngest sister was born in 2009 and my youngest brother was born in 2010. The fights between siblings, adults, and in the families seemed to be less and less with the presence of two tiny children. Then, before I was really taught what sexual assault was, I was sexually assaulted by a friend of my stepsisters one night at the age of 10, with her and others sitting feet away from me. After that, my father's house became a safe haven before I knew what a safe haven was. Then, in 2013 at the age of 11, tragedy struck, and my father died. This escalated the drugs and alcohol being consumed and the fights turned physical instead of verbal. A vivid memory I have is my stepbrother being thrown into the wall by my stepfather and putting a hole in the plaster. He was kicked out of the house for dealing drugs soon after. A year or so later, I was called into the office on my fourteenth birthday to talk to DCFS about a physical fight that happened between my mother and stepsister in front of me, in my room. The entire night leading up to the fight was a screaming match between my stepsister and the parents. In result, my stepsister was moved into her mom's care. As a teenager still in Jr. High School, this was hard to process. I became a recluse. I lost my father, I lost my stepsiblings, my only parent was still fighting with her partner daily, and I felt like I had no one.</p>
<br>
<p>My stepfather left the house soon after a fight between himself, my mother and me. I heard a fight between them and stepped in to tell him off, at fourteen years old. I was then instructed by my mother to write a letter to him apologizing and telling him that I wanted him to move back in and that I loved him. My twelve-year-old brother was instructed to do the same. I went to school and cried at lunch while in a classroom with one of the best teachers that I know to this day, saying that I could not find the words to say and that I did not want to write the letter. She gave me the best piece of advice that I had received from any adult in that time period; if anyone has been verbally, mentally, emotionally, or physically abusive, then I have no obligation to lie about how I feel to appease them. I think she saved my future that day and I will forever be grateful to her. My mother and he separated soon after and it got better for a while. My mother also struggles with her mental health, but had not sought out any treatment for it. Money was tight with a single parent and four children after that, but I helped with my siblings a lot more than what I saw my friends helping with theirs. Years later, this “helping out” reoccurred to a higher standard when my mother was working 80-hour work weeks. This was a lot for me to take on while still struggling with my mental health.</p>
<br>
<p>I think I pushed all of this trauma stated above to the side; I never dealt with it and tried to act like this perfect, happy person throughout high school. My mental health then was neglected, and I was suicidal at the age of sixteen and seventeen. I was put on antidepressants, which hurt my mental health more than it helped. I got worse after that and made a plan that was in motion before I thought about who would find me. I had a jack-and-jill bathroom with my youngest sister, and she brushed her teeth every morning in that bathroom where the plan was going to be brought to action. I stopped what I was doing and no one in the house had any idea for a long time. I also struggled with anorexia and purging at eighteen to try and fit in with society's beauty standard. I have only told a few people about my struggles. Why? Because of the stigma surrounding mental health and suicide. When I was first diagnosed with a case of mild depression and anxiety, a family member told me to, “Pull my head out of my ass.” Years later, I was told that I had no reason to be depressed, that I had everything I could ever want in my life.</p>
<br>
<p>I began seeking my own treatment in the form of therapy when I was nineteen years old, and I continue that treatment a year later at twenty years old. Working through trauma and accepting any mental health issues/diagnoses you may have is hard; I still struggle with my depression, anxiety, and trauma, but the difference is that I am trying to change and accept the past that has occurred. I want to be a different person in the future, one that may still have depression, but one that does not let her depression and trauma define who she is. There are so many stories that are similar to mine and also completely different, yet they are told that they have nothing to be “sad” about or that their troubles don’t compare to xyz person in xyz state, county, or country. I am here to say that you and your mental health matters. Your story may not match mine to a T, but your story and your feelings still matter. If I would have left this world when I thought I needed to, I would not be where I am today. I bought a house recently with my partner, I started a new job, I got a puppy, and while there are moments where depression kicks my ass, I am so much more happy at this point in my life than I was at sixteen and seventeen. Find something to live for and something to look forward to. You haven't finished that season of that show you started or there is another season coming out you haven't watched. Look forward to a clear sunrise with no trees or light poles in the way and watch as the sky changes colors. Look forward to the people who will become your best friends, as I have found mine three years after my first-almost attempt. I look forward to coming home to my partner who asks me how my day was and my puppy wiggling his tail so hard his whole body moves. With this in mind, life isn't easy and will be hard at points, but the laughter and the smiles you give and receive will make life so much easier than what it feels like at the moment.</p>
    
<p>There are a number of ways to get help, and I say this based on experience, but you have to want the help in order for it to be effective. Start by searching for providers for your mental health struggles near you. If you are in school then tell a well-trusted adult/counselor, speak to your parents if you feel it is safe, speak to a doctor at a check-up. Mental health is not a topic to shy away from and needs to be talked about.</p>
