<h3>The History</h3>  
    
<p> <a href="https://www.uniteforsight.org/mental-health/module2" target="_blank">Unite for Site suggests that,</a> in way earlier years, mental illness was considered a form of religious punishment or a possession for sins that one may have committed. But in the Middle Ages people flipped the script and thought that people NEEDED divine intervention to help with their mental illness. These negative views continued into the 18th and 19th centuries which lead to uhygenic and, often times, torturous confinement of mentally ill people.</p>

<p>People who were placed in inpatient care (hospitals/asylums) typically was considered the most effective way to care for the mentally ill by the public. "Institutionalization was also welcomed by families and communities struggling to care for mentally ill relatives. Although institutionalized care increased patient access to mental health services, the state hospitals were often underfunded and understaffed, and the institutional care system drew harsh criticism following a number of high-profile reports of poor living conditions and human rights violations." By the 1950's,  By the late-1950s, especially during JFK's time in office, a push for deinstitutionalization and outpatient treatment began facilitated by the development of a variety of antipsychotic drugs. Deinstitutionalization efforts have proceeded to abandon the "asylum-based" care system and more towards community-care, such as group homes or beahvioral health centers located within communities, not ouside of them.</p>
<h3>More Recent Years</h3>
<p>"Although large inpatient psychiatric hospitals are a fixture in certain countries, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, the deinstitutionalization movement has been widespread, dramatically changing the nature of modern psychiatric care." Throughout the United States, specifically the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963, helped close state psychiatric hospitals, i.e. "asylums." It is now the law that someone can only be committed anywhere (hospital, psychiatric wards, etc.) if they are a danger to themselves or others. "The number of institutionalized mentally ill patients fell from its peak of 560,000 in the 1950s to 130,000 by 1980. By 2000, the number of state psychiatric hospital beds per 100,000 people was 22, down from 339 in 1955." <a href="https://www.uniteforsight.org/mental-health/module2" target="_blank">To learn more about the history of mental health, visit Unite Forsight.</a></p>
<h3>Now that you know the history of what mentally ill people have been through, it is now time to talk about why the stigma surrounding mental health needs to be abolished. Mental health is also known as a taboo topic mainly because of the history surrounding mental health.</h3>
<p> A taboo is a social or religious custom prohibiting or forbidding discussion of a particular practice or forbidding association with a particular person, place, or thing. <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taboo" target="_blank">(Merriam-Webster)</a></p>
<p>Stigma is when someone, or a group of people, views you in a negative way based on a characteristic/trait that is thought to be or actually is a disadvantage. Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477" target="_blank">The Mayo Clinic states,</a> "stigma can lead to discrimination. Discrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative remark about your mental illness or your treatment. Or it may be unintentional or subtle, such as someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. You may even judge yourself."</p>
<p>Some of the harmful effects of stigma can include:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Not wanting to seek help</li> 
<li>Lack of understanding by family and friends</li>
<li>Bullying, pysical violence, or harassment</li>
<li>Helath insurance that will not cover full, or even partial, cost of treatment</li>
<li>The belief that you can't improve your situation</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Now how to help</h2>
<p>There are many ways to help dissolve the stigma and tabooness surrounding the conversation of mental health. Here are a few that are both suggested by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477" target="_blank">the Mayo Clinic</a> and suggested from personal experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't shut down:</b> when someone is speaking with you about their mental health in the moment or about their journey, do not shut down and become a person that are unfamiliar with when they trusted you enough to share this information with you. Be as understanding and as accepting as you can be.</li>
<li><b>Share your story:</b> whether you share your story with other people in person, online, or to yourself with journaling, share it. It helps to share your story when you feel alone, because in reality, you are not alone. Sharing your story will help you to realize this, even if it is to yourself.</li>
<li><b>Get treatment:</b> you may feel like you do not need treatment or are told that you are making a bigger deal of your mental health than what you think it is. You aren't. Treatment can provide relief and validation by identifying what is wrong and reducing the symptoms that are interfering with your life.</li>
<li><b>Don't isolate yourself:</b> If you have a mental illness, you may be reluctant to tell anyone about it. Your family and friends can offer you support if they know about your mental illness. Reach out to people you trust for the help that you need. You may need to go into further detail to explain your circumstances if those around you are uneducated in the topic of mental illness. </li>
<li><b>Don't equate yourself with your illness:</b> you are not an illness. So instead of saying "I'm depressed," say "I have depression."</li>
<li><b>Join a suppoprt group:</b> some local and national groups, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), offer local programs and internet resources that help educate people who have a mental illness and their families/friends. In and around Decatur, Illinois, Heritage is a big resource for those who need help and do not know where to start. They have group and individual sessions for those who prefer one over the other.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Judgement from those around you comes from not understanding/believing in mental illness. The first step to recover from any mental illness is learning to accept your condition and start making the steps to get help.</p>
